# Convolutional Neural Networks for Skin Cancer Detection

At this current date, studies indicate promising results when applying artificial neural networks for image classification. However, the application to skin cancer detection is limited, and even moreso is the number of successful attempts via smartphones. This project was initiated in response to the low success rate of creating an efficient skin cancer diagnosing smartphone application, by applying a Convolution Neural Networks algorithm provided by the deeplearning4j library.

## Current Status

The program in its basic state is completed.

The next step is to perform tests and optimize the neural network.
I also plan to implement a script that automatically downloads the database of images used for training and testing the network. (ISIC database).
I also plan to implement an automatic file distibutor, which will take the data from a single database and randomly sort the data into a training and testing file.

The program is currently unable to run on the smartphone. Such compatibility is still being developed.
