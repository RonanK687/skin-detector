# Convolutional Neural Networks for Skin Cancer Detection

At this current date, studies indicate promising results when applying artificial neural networks for image classification. However, the application to skin cancer detection is limited, and even moreso are the number of successful attempts at skin cancer classification via smartphones. This project initiated in response to the low success rate at creating an efficient skin cancer diagnosing smartphone application, by applying Convolution Neural Networks algorithms provided by the deeplearning4j library.

## Current Status

The program in its basic state is completed.

The next step is to perform tests and optimize the neural network. 
I also plan to implement an automatic file distibutor, which will take the data from a single database and randomly sort the data into a training and testing file.

The program currently unable to run on the smartphone. Such compatibility is still being implemented.
